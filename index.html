    <h1>API Usage Example</h1>
    <h2>Describe the API you selected and why you selected it</h2>
    <p>The selected API is the GitHub REST API, specifically the endpoint to retrieve file contents from a repository. This API was chosen because it allows users to access and view the contents of files stored in GitHub repositories, which is essential for understanding and managing code.</p>
    
    <h2>Cite the website where you found it</h2>
    <p>The GitHub REST API documentation can be found at <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">GitHub REST API Documentation</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Describe the options/parameters you used for the API request â€“ i.e., what info did you need to provide (in the query string) to the API to get your results?</h2>
    <p>For the API request, the following parameters were provided:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>path</strong>: The file path within the repository (<code>index.html</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>repo</strong>: The repository name and owner (<code>lhaugh01/assignment6</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Give an example of where this API would be helpful.</h2>
    <p>This API would be helpful in scenarios where developers need to programmatically access and review the contents of code files in a repository, such as for automated code reviews, continuous integration workflows, or generating documentation.</p>
